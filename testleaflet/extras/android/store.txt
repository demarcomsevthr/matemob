DESCRIZIONE COMPLETA

Therapy Reminder is an innovative application that allows you to have under control every drugs prescription.

The only App that alerts you or a tutor if you forgot to take your medicine!

The only App that reminds you in advance to reorder the drug!

For each prescription you can enter the name of the drug, the quantity to be taken, and in which days and times you have to take it.

At the expiration of each intake you will be notified with an alert that will remind you to take that medication.

You can also set an alert to be notified when the pack of medication is about to end.

Even more interesting: you can use the ONLINE MODE that allows you to record a tutor (with name, email and/or mobile phone number) and alert him or her if you forget to take a certain drug.

Finally, you have a control panel in which you can get a quick overview of all entered prescriptions and the ability to store the contact details of your medical officers.
